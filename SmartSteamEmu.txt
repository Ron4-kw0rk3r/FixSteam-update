This is a steam client emulator which enables you to play steam
games without STEAM client and play lobby enabled-games or
online multiplayer games on LAN without any internet connection.

This emulator initially intended only for Age of Empires II HD
to enable lobby features without depending on STEAM. Now the
emulator has been updated and can be used with other steam's
game.


Features:
 - Run steam game without steam
 - Enables play on LAN without internet connection
 - Emulates lobby, server browser
 - Emulates CS:GO items/inventory
 - Stats, Achievements and Save games
 - Configurable DLC subscription
 - Avatar support
 - Plugins support
 - UGC/Steam Workshop partial support

Requirements:
 - Microsoft(R) Visual C++ 2010 Runtime (x86)
 - .NET Framework 4 (SSELauncher only)
 - Steam games

How to use:
 - Extract all files to game directory or any directory.
 - Open SmartSteamEmu.ini and edit as neccessary.
 - Launch SmartSteamLauncher.exe and not the game executable.
 - To use different configuration file, add configuration file path
   to launcher parameter.
 - Put your plugins into SmartSteamEmu\Plugins folder. SmartSteamEmu
   will automatically load the dll files.

Note:
 If your games use cracked version that replace steam_api.dll,
 make sure you restore the original steam_api.dll file first.

 Some games may require pre-cracked file to run the games, but be
 sure steam_api.dll is the original.

 Some games such as tomb raider that can host private match
 require invite friends function to invite others to join their
 private match. Since this emulator didn't have any invite friend
 implemented, to JOIN the server press SHIFT+TAB simultaneously.

Plugin Development:
 Plugin is simply a dll file to extend or change the emulator or game
 behaviour. The dll will be loaded by SmartSteamEmu via LoadLibrary().
 Additionally the plugin can have SmartInit() and SmartShutdown()
 exported function. To get better understanding, download the PDK.
